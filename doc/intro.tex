In a forthcoming paper we analyzed unique regions in 18 mammalian
genomes. In this document we explain our analysis of unique genomic
regions by describing in full detail their detection and annotation in
one of one of these genomes, that of human. This is done in three
steps, pick unique regions, annotate unique regions with genes, and
carry out functional enrichment analysis of these genes.
