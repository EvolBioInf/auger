## Installation
We install the dependencies using the script [`setup.sh`](scripts/setup)

```
bash scripts/setup.sh
```

Having installed the dependencies, we clone the `auger` repo, change
into it, and make the programs. They are now located in the directory
`build`.

```
git clone https://github.com/evolbioinf/auger
cd auger
make
```
